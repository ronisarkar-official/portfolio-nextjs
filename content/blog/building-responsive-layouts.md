# Building Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox

Creating responsive layouts is essential for modern web development. With CSS Grid and Flexbox, you can build complex, flexible layouts that work across all device sizes.

## CSS Flexbox

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts - either rows or columns. It's perfect for:

- Navigation menus
- Card layouts
- Centering elements
- Distributing space between items

Here's a simple example of a responsive navigation menu using Flexbox:

```css
.nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.nav-item {
  padding: 1rem;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .nav {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

## CSS Grid

CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts - rows and columns together. It's ideal for:

- Page layouts
- Image galleries
- Complex dashboard interfaces
- Any design requiring precise placement in two dimensions

Here's an example of a responsive grid layout:

```css
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 1rem;
}

.gallery-item {
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

## Combining Grid and Flexbox

For the most powerful layouts, you can combine both:

- Use Grid for the overall page layout
- Use Flexbox for components within the grid

## Conclusion

CSS Grid and Flexbox have revolutionized web layout design. By mastering these tools, you can create responsive, flexible layouts that work beautifully across all devices.
